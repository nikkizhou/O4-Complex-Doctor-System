# Complex-doctor-system-Java
In this schoole work I wrote a complex system for doctors(Doc-), medicines(L-), prescriptions(R-) and patients, by using the classes in O2() and O3(). The data structure is in the link of O2 and O3.

This is a practice for SUBCLASS, LINKEDLIST(Li-) and comprehensive OO SKILLS.
